# 360WebPano
Short example of a scrolling 360 pano images uding html, css and js. No other libraries which means limited functionality. Mobile support isn't great, but I just wanted something for my website and this works.

This is just a div with a background image that can be scrolled indefinately. There are plenty of other methods and examples avaiilable around the web, but these all required additional libraries or resources. Not being a programmer, I needed something simple that I could work with. This is it.
